<p class="lead">In a world obsessed with productivity, slowing down feels like a radical act of rebellion. But it is essential for our sanity and our soul.</p>

## Analog Habits
<p>There is a texture to real life that screens cannot replicate. The scratch of a pen on paper, the smell of old books, the warmth of a coffee mug. These sensory details ground us in the present moment.</p>

<p>I challenge you to spend the first hour of your day without a screen. No emails, no news, no feeds.</p>

## Digital Detoxing
<p>It's not about quitting technology. It's about setting boundaries. Turn off notifications. Use grayscale mode. Charge your phone outside the bedroom.</p>

<blockquote>"Slow living is not about doing everything at a snail's pace. It's about doing everything at the right speed."</blockquote>

<p>When we slow down, we don't miss out. We simply start paying attention to what actually matters.</p>
